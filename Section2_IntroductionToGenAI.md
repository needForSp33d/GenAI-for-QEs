Section 2 - Introduction to GenAI

What makes up AI?



Where do LLMs fit into AI?

- ML - deriving algorithmic insights from data permitting prediction
- DL - neural networks
- GEN AI - LLMs power this layer but are a fraction of the wider AI field.

Introduction to Natural Language Processing & Generation:

- NLP
- Subfield of AI allowing comprehension, interpretation, and generation of human-readable language.
- NLP: Prompt > 'Decomposition' > machine analysis (lexical, semantic, pragmatic, disclosure) > insert into model.
- NLG: Foundation model > generate content > response.

Types of ML

In essence, 'learn' from data that has been input, and generate an output based on applied algorithms. 

Supervised ML
- Machine 'learns', but is 'supervised' by a person/system.
- Data input is predefined in some way - for example labelled in order to train and ensure machine 'interprets' data correctly.

Unsupervised ML
- As above, but without outside intervention.
- Algorithms stills applied to support machine independent identification of patterns.
- To general labels and 'reasons' for the classification.

Reinforced ML
- Combines ML + AI/human oversight to support/corroborate results. This provides feedback to the machine.

Deep Learning
- Variant of Reinforced ML, but progressive move through different layers of analysis to ensure fine-tuning.
