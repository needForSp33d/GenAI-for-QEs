# AUT - Blazedemo.com
- Basic practice web application for searching and purchasing flgihts.

# Selecting best framework for the chosen website
- 01-preview will be used as the best framework for reasoning.
- Model used to identify the best framework for the AUT and the relevant constraints (time/skill/cost) not to mention requirements for the framework (browsers/language/devices).

# Installing VS Code
- Go install it for your OS.

# Installing NODE
- Go install it for your OS.

# Setting up the Prerequisites with ChatGPT
- Use the GenAI tool to get a step-by-step guide to install and setup the relevant automation tool so it is then ready to go.

# Install Playwright and Demo Test
- Installed above

# Deciding what is most important for Testing
- Using the o1-ChatGPT is valuable because of the complex reasoning component.
- By targeting the website you can gain A VIEW of what might be important to validate.

# Completing the Test and generating first Draft Code with Mini o1 Model
- The o1-mini model is the best for test code generation.
- Using the GenAI to 'extend' the test case to provide a full customer journey is a time-saver.
- Then prompting the GenAI to generate the test code itself for the TOOL and with the relevant LANGUAGE/DESIGN PATTERN will give a large amount of test code to test, validate, and refactor to ensure it works quickly.

# Debug manually code
- Initial failures are expected, so now that just need to be fixed.

# Code Debug with ChatGPT-o1 and Canvas & Adding Screenshots for the tests
- Inclusion of test code and the relevant failure code into the ChatGPT prompt is used to elicit targeted responses.
- Iterative process of testing, refactoring, and retesting performed.

# Best Practices and some future considerations
- Abstracting the test data to make it modular and parameterise it using the page object model - as an example.
