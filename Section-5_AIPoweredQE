# QE Use Cases

## AI Assisted Code Coverage

- With access to code base and a coverage report, then guide the model to fill in the gaps.
- Before committing the code, reviewing the coverage, and then using prompts to reinforce the positive or negative outcomes.
- Human review is essential for sense-checking.

## Self Healing Code

- Using Generative AI to tweak failing code.
- Integrating an 'autoheal-tests' job within a Github Actions workflow.
- Using the API integration with a Gen AI tool to pass over the failing code and a prompt requesting changes.
- Autocommits of the response payload should then prompt the same unit tests and coverage checks to determine whether the code coverage is complete.

## Analytics-Based Testing

- Implement a BDD approach to describe the application behaviour.
- Any AC can then be mapped to the specific automated checks that are written in the human-readable BDD format.
- Use Google Analytics to understand user interaction and behaviour with the application.
- What are the most prevalent journeys and features being used?
- This enables you to prioritise targeting to testing.

## Tests Based on Analytics

- Testing in production provides highest levels of confidence possible.
- GA-informed tests provide the most valuable data and insights to guide testing - rather than guessing at what is most important to cover.
- Acceptance tests allow continuous validation that the application supports the desired user behaviour.
- GA data provides continuous feedback on the scenarios that are being validated by the acceptance tests.
- A model can then provide a summary of what IS being tested vs the user behaviour in the real world. This 'delta' or 'difference' can then inform the next steps.
- It helps to ensure that use cases beyond the linear customer journey will be validated.

## Test Case Generation

- Combine raw data with sample data to demonstrate the required format.
- To provide the LLM with sufficient contextual information, you might use UI elements, the webpage, wireframes, mock-ups etc.
- Existing test cases, scripts, and pag object files also provide very clear direction of the desired output.
- A 'foundation model' needs to be rained on these varied datasets.
