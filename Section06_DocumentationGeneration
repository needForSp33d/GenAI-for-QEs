# Concept Explanation
- Terms such as 'shift-left' and 'shift-right' used as examples.
- Using successive prompts to 'layer' context into the 'conversation' is a method to develop a more sophisticated dialogue.
- Further probing and question-asking helps to gain greater detail, alternatives, and explanations.

# Accelerate your Documentation
- The more sophisticated the prompt, the better and more nuanced the response.
- Use of key words helps to ensure that specific traits, qualities, or topics are included in the response as desired.
- The better the prompt, the better the answer. Obvious really.
- More specific details helps to avoid an overly generic response.
- Demonstrates the value of using GenAI to rapidly progress you from the blank page to a general template - to a more refined, customised, and specific artefact.

# Creating a Test Framework
- Ensure the context is established.
- Provide the full-stack context from DB 2 BE 2 FE 2 Design 2 Timescales 2 Budgetary constraints.
- Checking for alternatives is a useful exercise to prompt for.
- "Enjoy it, its great. It gives you all the right answers if you know how to ask the right questions".

# User Story Enhancement & Validation
- Example uses ChatGPT to provide alternative perspectives - challenger AI.
- Validate/extend user stories from alternative perspectives.
- Identifying whether any requirement categories are missing - such as NFRs.

# Test Case Generation
- Continuing from the 'User Story' example above, specific test cases can now be generated.
- Explicit test cases and test steps can be triggered and the formatting/pattern can be clearly defined too.
- Test preconditions and requirements can also be expanded upon automatically.

# Leveraging Chat History Context
- Continuing the chat allows you to elaborate/pivot from previously generated responses, while also retaining the context that has been established beforehand.
