# Agentic AI | AI Agents - What are AI Agents
- Defined as automonomous agents using tools to complete tasks.
- Task driven and 'prompted' to produce specific outputs.
- Therefore, dependant on the user to provide 'the right' prompt.
- Could rely on simple prompts or on prompt chaining from one LLM to another.
- The agent as orchestrator or conductor.

# Agentic AI - Demo On AI Agent that can Automatically Create Tests
- Flowise AI is the tool to create an agent.
- Flowise as tool for stitching different components together.
- Able to generate a flow or 'story' that can then grab and interpret the prompt before generating the relevant tests.

# Agentic AI | AI Agents - What is Flowise AI
- Drag & drop engine for creating agents to solve a range of usecases.
- Free to run locally - once using cloud resources, then you have to pay for Flowise specifically.
- Tool optimised for orchestrating LLMs, you just need the relevant account & API key.

# Agentic AI | AI Agents - Installing Flowise AI Locally
- Use npm to install the tool.
- Big install, > 10 minutes.

# Agentic AI | AI Agents - Prompt Chaining
- The 'supervisor' app is required to orchestrate the various 'nodes' or 'workers' through the flow.
- An AI Key will be required to 'power' the flow, specify the model, and the 'temperature' value.
- Each aspect can be configured slightly differently.
- Iterative process of trial & error can itself be automated - with various personas, and prompts pre-defined and then applied to the preceding output.

# Agentic AI | AI Agents - Interact with files
- Prompt chains can also be used to read from, interact with files, and generate new file outputs (both content, format, and type).
- Example uses stories as initial prompts - refining, in-built prompts, in-built checking/challenger prompts - to then generate test code that can test application code based on these prompts.

# Agentic AI | AI Agents - Generate Automated Tests from Webpage
- Similar to the preceding chapter, an application called 'Fire-crawl' that turns the website into an LLM-ready dataset.
- A map, data, and digital structure is established.
